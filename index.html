Custom Built Homes

Building custom homes for people in the Upper Peninsula has always been our passion and that’s exactly what we set out to do almost 15 years ago with the formation of G.E. Builders Inc. of Negaunee, Michigan. We offer our passion and our expertise as we guide your decisions throughout the entire process, from design to construction. Our completion times may vary, but the whole process generally takes 6 to 7 months from start to finish. You’ll be inviting your family and friends into your new home for dinner before you know it.
<br><br>
<h3>

  Designs & Blueprints
</h3>

It all starts with an idea. We’ll help you visualize your ideas throughout our design process by providing you with accurate blueprints showing how your new home will be laid out. We will explore all pertinent questions involved in choosing what’s best for you and your family, such as:



     
    <li id="services-span"> How many bathrooms do you need?</li>
    <li id="services-span"> How many bedrooms do you need?</li>
    <li id="services-span">
      How many stories would you like your home to have?
    </li> <li id="services-span">
      Do you want garage bays?
    </li> <li id="services-span">
      What is your ideal square footage?
      <li id="services-span">
        Do you already have a particular style of home in mind?
        
        to name a few.</li>
